        A minimal reproduction is ideal—focus on isolating the bug without extra dependencies or irrelevant code.
        If you need guidance, see [this guide on creating a minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
        Issues without a reproduction repository are difficult to investigate and are very likely to stall.'
