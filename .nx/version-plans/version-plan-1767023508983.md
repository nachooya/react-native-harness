The module mocking system has been rewritten to improve compatibility with different versions of React Native. Instead of fully overwriting Metro's module system, the new implementation surgically redirects responsibility for imports to Harness, allowing for better integration with various React Native versions while maintaining the same mocking capabilities. The module mocking API has been slightly modified as part of this rewrite.
