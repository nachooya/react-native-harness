⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL** ⚠️

An experimental Jest runner that integrates React Native Harness with Jest's infrastructure. This package allows you to leverage existing Jest features like watchers, coverage reporting, and the familiar developer experience while running React Native Harness tests.

## Features

- **Jest Integration**: Re-uses Jest's existing infrastructure for a familiar developer experience
- **Watch Mode**: Automatic test re-running when files change
- **Coverage Reports**: Built-in code coverage support through Jest
- **Serial Execution**: Tests run sequentially to ensure proper React Native environment management
- **Harness Configuration**: Supports all React Native Harness runners and configurations

## Usage

This runner is designed to work with Jest's test runner system. Configure it in your Jest configuration to run React Native Harness tests through Jest's interface.
